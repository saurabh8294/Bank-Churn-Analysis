## Bank Churn Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

### About the Project

This project is a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze **Bank Churn** — the rate at which customers stop doing business with a bank. It is designed to help stakeholders quickly identify churn trends, customer behavior patterns, and key performance metrics that can support customer retention strategies.

### Objective

The goal of this project is to:

* Monitor the churn rate over time
* Compare active vs inactive customer trends
* Analyze customer bifurcation by credit score, gender, and card status
* Provide valuable insights to help the bank reduce customer exits
